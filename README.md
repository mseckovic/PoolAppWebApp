# App description
- The application should provide access for two groups of users. The first group of users are administrators who have access to the list of all scheduled appointments for the use of the training pool, to enter new free appointments into the database, as well as to cancel existing reservations. The administrator can also edit the content of pages on the site, which is an integral part of the interface for other users of the site. 
Other users of the site must log in to the portal in order to access it, and they do so via the portal login form. If the user does not have an account, he must register using a new account registration form. The user enters his data, including name, surname, telephone number and e-mail address. When the user logs in to the port with the correct username and password, he will be shown a list of all open terms in which there are vacancies, which have not yet passed. 
The user activates the option to register an appointment and confirms his registration for a specific appointment (date and time). After selecting and confirming the registration for the term for the use of the pool, that and all other terms that have not passed are available in the list "My dates". Terms canceled by the administrator are displayed in the list as "canceled" and should be highlighted (with a color or thumbnail next to the date). 
The user can also cancel his appointment to use the pool. The website hosts pages that are an integral part of the web application, such as "rules on the use of swimming pools", "rules on registration of terms", "instructions for registration", "contact page", etc. These pages are edited by the administrator through the content management panel he has access to. The graphical interface of the website should be implemented with a responsive design.
